- Web Server: *An internal or external web server is required to host all generated files. For Bukkit users, consider using plugins that provide internal web server functionality.*

- Data Subdirectory Protection: *Consider securing the data subdirectory using tools like .htaccess or similar methods.*

- Josh's More Foods Compatibility: *If [Josh's More Foods](https://modrinth.com/datapack/joshs-more-foods/) is installed, a [script](assets/items/joshs-more-foods/rp-downloader.py) is available to download necessary images. Run it once to ensure compatibility.*

## Usage Instructions:

1. Install Python3 and required plugins.
2. Set up scheduled jobs for providing YAML files and running the conversion script.
3. Optionally configure the batch script for automated tasks and file export.
4. Deploy an internal or external web server, considering Bukkit plugins for internal hosting. *(You can find many instructions on the internet on how to host a web server)*
